# Memex
An application for creating meme using splashbase api

# GETTING  STARTED

This assignment will see you creating an online meme creation tool, using the splashbase as an image source.
  1. You will allow the user of the web tool to enter some search query terms, click a "Load Image" button.
  2. Clicking the "Load Image" button should present the user with a random images from the splashbase api (or notify the user somehow that no results were found).
  3. You should select the first image obtained from the api.
  4. Enter a caption and select the caption location on the right to put the caption on the selected image.
  5. By clicking on "Save Meme" button user can save the meme and it would be visible in the saved memes section.
  6. This tool simply creates meme and lets user save it. You have to implement saving the image.
  7. Your image should be centered horizontally, be sized appropriately, and retain its aspect ratio.
  8. Your caption position choice should place the caption text inside the image at the specified location. All caption text should be centered horizontally. Your web tool should be responsive and handle mobile screen resolutions without impacting the user experience.

# GUIDELINES
 1. Running npm install && npm start should be the only command required after cloning to demo your app.
 2. Use only React/Redux, Webpack, SCSS/LESS(CSS3), HTML5 and anymore related UI tool.
 3. Make some appropriate creative choices about how to implement and style the web tool
 4. Loading the splashbase api results should be asynchronous and display a loading or searching visual.
 5. Editing the caption text should appear on the image as it is typed.
 6. Error should be handled gracefully.
 7. Try to optimise the build.
 8. Documentation including the details of app and its components.
 8. Host it using any free hosting service.(optional)
 9. The app should be PWA (optional)
